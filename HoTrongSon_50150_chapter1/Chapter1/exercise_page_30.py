# PROBLEM:
#     1. Suppose your script attempts to print the value of a variable that has not yet been
#     assigned a value. How does the Python interpreter react?
#     2. Miranda has forgotten to complete an arithmetic expression before the end of a line
#     of code. How will the Python interpreter react?
#     3. Why does Python code generate fewer types of syntax errors than code in other
#     programming languages?


# SOLUTION:
#     1)
#       It halts the execution and it has an error message.

#     2)
#       It will notify her that the program is missing syntax.

#     3)
#       It helps programmers complete the program in fewer steps, but in return, the program will take longer to run
