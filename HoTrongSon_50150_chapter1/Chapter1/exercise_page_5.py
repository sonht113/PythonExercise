# PROBLEM:
#     1.List three common types of computing agents
#     2.Write an algorithm that describes the second part of the process of making change
#     (counting out the coins and bills).
#     3. Write an algorithm that describes a common task, such as baking a cake or operating a DVD player.
#     4. Describe an instruction that is not well defined and thus could not be included as a
#     step in an algorithm. Give an example of such an instruction.
#     5. In what sense is a laptop computer a general-purpose problem-solving machine?
#     6. List four devices that use computers and describe the information that they process.
#     (Hint: Think of the inputs and outputs of the devices.)

# SOLUTION:
#     1)
#       CPU, memory, input and output devices
#     2)
# countProduct= int(input("Nhap vao so luong san pham da mua: "))
# print(countProduct)
# countMoney = 0
# for product in countProduct:
#         money = int(input("Nhập số tiền của sàn phẩm thứ " + product +": "))
#         countMoney += money
# print(countMoney)
# print("Hoa Don cua ban la: " + countMoney)
# """
#     3)
#       Largest search in a list of ordinal random numbers:
#           Step 1: If there are no numbers in the set then there is no highest number.
#           Step 2: Assume the first number in the set is the largest number in the set.
#           Step 3: For each remaining number in the set: if this number is larger than the current largest number,
#               consider this number to be the largest number in the set.
#           Step 4: When there are no numbers left in the set to iterate over, consider the current largest number to be the largest number of the set.
#     4)
#     An instruction that is not well defined is one that can not be performed effectively or cannot be executed by a computing agent.
#     An example would be a step that says to divide a number by 0

#     5)
#       Since a wristwatch tells time and could compute a few calculations, the laptop computer is a general-purpose problem-solving machine
#       because it can do general purposes in a wide range computer programs. It is a calculator,
#       it can open web browsing to solve problems (emergency systems), download new information, etc.

#     6)
#       Smartwatches: Uses the input from the touchscreen to output appropriate apps to measure workouts
#       digital multimeter: receives the input circuit which gives a digital display of the amount of volts from the circuit.
#       Computer has a keyboard that outputs letters, numbers, and symbols to the appropriate key
#       Insulin pump inputs of certain buttons allows the machine to deliver proper amounts of insulin.
