Problem:
    1.  In what way is a recursive design different from top-down design?
Solution:
    Result:
        -   The bottom-up approach (to dynamic programming) consists in first looking at the "smaller" subproblems,
        and then solve the larger subproblems using the solution to the smaller problems.
        -   The top-down consists in solving the problem in a "natural manner" and check if you have calculated the solution to the subproblem before.
