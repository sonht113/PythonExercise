Problem:
    5.  Explain what happens when the following recursive function is called with the value 4 as an argument:
            def example(n):
                if n > 0:
                    print(n)
                    example(n)
                else:
                    example(n - 1)

Solution:
    Result:
        -   Falls into a cyclic infinite loop because the stopping condition is not true
