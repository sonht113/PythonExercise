Problem:
    3.  Describe the costs and benefits of defining and using a recursive function.
Solution:
    Result:
        -   Recursion is a fundamental concept in programming that sets and results in consulting problem solving.
            Many problems after being analyzed can be solved by recursion and at the same time many other problems,
            if approaching with recursion, will save a lot of verbose code.
        -   Regularly practicing problem solving with recursion will help to be very helpful for the algorithmic
            thinking of novices, when they should learn how to approach and handle problems logically and as safe
            as possible.
