Problem:
    7.  Explain what happens when the following recursive function is called with the values "hello" and 0
        as arguments:
            def example(aString, index):
               if index == len(aString):
                   return ""
                else:
                   return aString[index] + example(aString, index + 1)
Solution:
    Result:
        -   Print to the screen the characters at the index position until the index is equal to the length
            of the array. In this case, we get the input string
