Problem:

    2)  Explain how an algorithm solves a general class of problems and how a function definition can support
        this property of an algorithm.

Solution:
    2)
        -   An algorithm is a general method for solving a class of problems. The individual problems that
            make up a class of problems are known as problem instances. The problem instances for our summation
            gorithm are the pairs of numbers that specify the lower and upper bounds of the range of numbers to
            be summed.
        -   When you design an algorithm, it should be general enough to provide a solution to many problem
            instances, not just one or a few of them.
        -   The summation function contains both the code for the summation algorithm and the means of supplying
            problem instances to this algorithm. The problem instances are the data sent as arguments to the function.
