Problem:

    1.  Anne complains that defining functions to use in her programs is a lot of extra work. She says she can
        finish her programs much more quickly if she just writes them using the basic operators and control
        statements. State three reasons why her view is shortsighted.

Solution:
    1)
    -   Functions avoid repetition in the code.
    -   Code can be broken down into sub-parts using functions. which is easy to understand by any new
        joiner.
    -   Function can be given a convenient name that describes its use in the program.
