Problem:

    2.  What is the scope of a variable? Give an example.
Solution:
    Result:
        -   A scope is a region of the program and broadly speaking there are three places, where variables can
            be declared:
            +   Inside a function or a block which is called local variables,
            +   In the definition of function parameters which is called formal parameters.
            +   Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
        -   As in the example below, the scope of variable 'n' is only invoked and used within the scope of the
            function 'example'.

    if n > 0:
        print(n)

    example(5)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
