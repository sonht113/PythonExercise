PROBLEM:
    3.  Explain the role of the variable in the header of a for loop.

SOLUTION:

=>       A header specifying the iteration, and a body which is executed once per iteration.
        The header often declares an explicit loop counter or loop variable, which allows
        the body to know which iteration is being executed.
