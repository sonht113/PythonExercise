Problem:
    10. The credit plan at TidBit Computer Store specifies a 10% down payment and an annual interest rate of 12%.
        Monthly payments are 5% of the listed purchase price, minus the down payment. Write a program that takes the
        purchase price as input. The program should display a table, with appropriate headers, of a payment schedule
        for the lifetime of the loan. Each row of the table should contain the following items:

        -   the month number (beginning with 1)
        -   the current total balance owed
        -   the interest owed for that month
        -   the amount of principal owed for that month
        -   the payment for that month
        -   the balance remaining after payment

        The amount of interest for a month is equal to balance * rate / 12. The amount of principal for a month
        is equal to the monthly payment minus the interest owed.
