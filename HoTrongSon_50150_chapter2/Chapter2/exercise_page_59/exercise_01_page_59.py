PROBLEM:
    1) Explain the relationship between a function and its arguments.

SOLUTION:
    1)
    =>  All functions are values; I can place them in a variable or pass them as an argument, for example. a and b are arguments of add , but the function has not been called, so they do not have values.
        Similarly, the function has been called, so it has no return value.
