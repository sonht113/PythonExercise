PROBLEM:
    5) An object’s momentum is its mass multiplied by its velocity. Write a program
    that accepts an object’s mass (in kilograms) and velocity (in meters per second) as
    inputs and then outputs its momentum.

SOLUTION:
    ....
"""
# Code here:
mass = float(input("Mass: "))
velocity = float(input("Velocity: "))
momentum = mass * velocity
print("The object's momentum is ", momentum)

# => Result:
# Mass: 3
# Velocity: 3
# The object's momentum is  9.0
