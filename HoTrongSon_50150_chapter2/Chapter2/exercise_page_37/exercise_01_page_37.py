# PROBLEM:
# 1. List four phases of the software development process, and explain what they accomplish.

# SOLUTION:
# 1) Four phases:
# - Phase 1 - Development:
# -> This is where the application or software is ideated and created.
#   Finding and fixing application security issues in this early stage is far less costly than waiting until after an application has been deployed,
#   so empowering developers to create secure software from inception is critical.
# - Phase 2 - Testing:
# -> Once an application is created, it should be further tested before it’s released in a live environment. Even if you included security in your design,
#    it may meet new challenges in a real-world situation.
# - Phase 3 - Deployment:
# -> With these tests completed, it’s time for deployment. But inevitably, not all vulnerabilities can be remediated for every application before it goes live.
#   Misconfigurations in production environments can introduce issues not present in pre-production, and new zero-day vulnerabilities arise in between release cycles.
# - Phase 4 - Monitoring:
# -> These tasks, plus the security testing required in the early stages of application development, are critical. But they can be time-consuming and they require expertise to deploy correctly.
#   That’s why many agencies leverage application security services.
