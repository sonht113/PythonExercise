PROBLEM:
  2) Explain the differences between the data types int and float.
SOLUTION:
  2)
  => Integers and floats are two different kinds of numerical data.
    - An integer (more commonly called an int) is a number without a decimal point.
    - A float is a floating-point number, which means it is a number that has a decimal place.
    Floats are used when more precision is needed.
