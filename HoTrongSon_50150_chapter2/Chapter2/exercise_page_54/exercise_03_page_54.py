PROBLEM:
    3) How does a Python programmer round a float value to the nearest int value?

SOLUTION:
    3)
    =>   Python provides an inbuilt function round() which rounds off to the given number of digits and returns the floating-point number,
        if no number of digits is provided for round off, it rounds off the number to the nearest integer.
