PROBLEM:
   4) What happens when the print function prints a string literal with embedded
    newline characters?

SOLUTION:
    4)
    => The print function denoted print() in a computer programming language such as Python is a function that prints values assigned to its parameter.
    When assigned a string literal("I'm not going" for example) and break line statements/new line characters(\n),
    it prints the value such as "I'm not going\n" and starts a new line where a break line is indicated in the instruction(after "going" in the example)
