Problem:

    7.  Describe the costs and benefits of aliasing, and explain how it can be avoided.
Solution:
    Result:
        Aliasing can make the different signals for becoming in-distinguishable from one another.

        Aliasing can be reduced with the help of sampling, which is done at a higher rate than that of the Nyquist rate.

        Anti-aliasing technique is being used for eliminating the effect of overlaping of the frequency components.
