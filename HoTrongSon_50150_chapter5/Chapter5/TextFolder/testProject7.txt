A list is a sequence of zero or more elements. The elements can be of any type. The len
function returns the number of elements in its list argument. Each element occupies a
position in the list. The positions range from 0 to the length of the list minus 1.

Lists can be manipulated with many of the operators used with strings, such as the sub-
script, concatenation, comparison, and in operators. Slicing a list returns a sublist.
The list is a mutable data structure. An element can be replaced with a new element,
added to the list, or removed from the list. Replacement uses the subscript operator.
The list type includes several methods for insertion and removal of elements.
